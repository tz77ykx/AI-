Most people use Claude like a search box. Ask, answer, close tab. They are leaving the best feature locked.

Save this :)

Stanford built a research system called STORM. In peer reviewed testing it produced articles **25 percent more organized** than the next best method. It is open source. It is free. Almost nobody knows you can run the same idea inside Claude with 4 prompts.

No software. No GitHub. No setup. Just paste. 5 minutes from now you will know more about your topic than people who spent days reading.

Here is the full method.

## Phase 1: What STORM Actually Is

STORM stands for **Synthesis of Topic Outlines through Retrieval and Multi perspective Question Asking.** It was published at NAACL 2024 by the Stanford OVAL Lab.

You can try the live version at [storm.genie.stanford.edu](https://storm.genie.stanford.edu/). Free. No sign up. Type a topic and watch it write a sourced article in front of you.

A 12 minute walkthrough video is here: STORM by Stanford on YouTube. Worth watching once.

The full code is at [github.com/stanford-oval/storm](https://github.com/stanford-oval/storm). MIT license. Run it on your own laptop if you want.

But here is the real prize. **You do not need any of it.** The Stanford method is just a way of thinking. You can run that same thinking inside Claude with 4 copy paste prompts.

That is what the rest of this article is.

## Phase 2: Why One Prompt Will Always Fail

When you ask Claude "tell me about X" you get the majority view. The most common framing. The surface.

What you do not get is the practitioner who works with X every day. The skeptic who thinks the field is wrong. The economist who follows the money. The historian who has seen the pattern before. The academic who actually read the studies.

Those five voices all see different things. That is what a PhD student does. They do not ask one question. They ask five.

The Stanford paper proved this with numbers. Articles built from multiple perspectives were **25 percent more organized and 10 percent broader in coverage** than articles built the normal way. That is the entire breakthrough. Multi perspective questioning catches blind spots that single prompt research never sees.

A PhD level research job takes 40 to 60 hours of human reading. Most people cannot spare that. STORM compresses it. The four prompts below compress it further. Five minutes total.

## Phase 3: Prompt 1, The Multi Perspective Scan

This is the heart of the method. Paste this into Claude. Replace the topic in line 1.

```
I need to research [YOUR TOPIC].
Simulate 5 different expert perspectives on this topic:
1. THE PRACTITIONER: works with this daily.
What do they know that academics miss?
What practical realities are usually ignored?
2. THE ACADEMIC: has studied this for years.
What does the peer reviewed evidence actually say?
Where does the evidence contradict popular belief?
3. THE SKEPTIC: thinks the mainstream view is wrong.
What is the strongest counterargument?
What evidence do proponents conveniently ignore?
4. THE ECONOMIST: follows the money.
Who profits from the current narrative?
What financial incentives shape the research?
5. THE HISTORIAN: has seen similar patterns before.
What historical parallels exist?
What can we learn from how those played out?
For each perspective give me:
- Their core position in 2 sentences
- The strongest evidence supporting their view
- The one thing they would tell me that no other perspective would
```

**What comes back:** five very different reads of the same topic. The practitioner sees what the academic misses. The skeptic challenges what the practitioner assumes. The economist exposes incentives the academic ignores. The historian provides patterns the economist cannot see.

This is 60 seconds of work that catches what one prompt never finds.

## Phase 4: Prompt 2, The Contradiction Map

Now make Claude find where the 5 voices fight. The fights are where real understanding lives.

```
Based on the 5 perspectives above, map the contradictions:
1. Where do two or more perspectives directly contradict
each other? List each conflict with the specific claims
that clash.
2. Which perspective has the strongest evidence?
Which has the weakest? Why?
3. What is the one question that, if answered, would
resolve the biggest contradiction?
4. What does EVERY perspective agree on?
(This is likely true. Even opponents confirm it.)
5. What topic did NONE of the perspectives address?
(This is the blind spot in the whole field.
Often the most valuable finding.)
```

**What comes back:** a map of where experts disagree and why. Most people skip this step. It is the step that separates surface understanding from real expertise.

If all 5 perspectives agree, it is probably true. If nobody addressed a topic, you just found the gap in the entire field.

## Phase 5: Prompt 3, The Synthesis

Now make Claude pull everything together into a research briefing.

```
Synthesize everything from the 5 perspectives and the
contradiction map into a research briefing:
1. THE ONE PARAGRAPH SUMMARY: explain this topic as if
briefing a CEO who has 60 seconds and needs nuance,
not just the headline.
2. THE 5 KEY FINDINGS: most important things I now know,
ranked by reliability. For each, note which perspectives
support it and which challenge it.
3. THE HIDDEN CONNECTION: one non obvious link between
findings that only shows up when you look at all 5
perspectives together.
4. THE ACTIONABLE INSIGHT: based on all the evidence,
what should someone in [YOUR ROLE] actually DO
differently? Be specific.
5. THE FRONTIER QUESTION: the one question that, if
answered, would change everything about how we
understand this topic.
```

**What comes back:** a briefing no single expert could write. It accounts for every angle, names the contradictions, ranks reliability, and lands on a specific action. This is what a PhD student would produce in 48 hours. You just got it in 90 seconds.

## Phase 6: Prompt 4, The Peer Review

STORM has one known weakness. Stanford's own researchers flagged it. The system does not self critique. **Source bias** and **fact misassociation** sneak in. This prompt fixes that by making Claude grade its own work.

```
Now peer review your own research briefing:
1. CONFIDENCE SCORES: rate each of the 5 key findings
on a 1 to 10 scale for reliability. Explain each score.
2. WEAKEST LINK: which claim are you least confident in?
What specific info would you need to verify it?
3. BIAS CHECK: which perspective might be overrepresented
in your synthesis? Did one voice dominate?
4. MISSING PERSPECTIVE: is there a 6th angle I should
have included that would change the conclusions?
5. OVERALL GRADE: if a Stanford professor reviewed this
briefing, what grade would they give and why?
What would they tell me to fix?
```

**What comes back:** an honest read of your own research. Strong claims, weak claims, biases, missing angles. Real peer review takes months. You just did it in 60 seconds.

## Phase 7: The 5 Minute Workflow

**Minute 1:** Prompt 1. You have 5 expert views.

**Minutes 2 to 3:** Prompt 2. You have a contradiction map.

**Minutes 3 to 4:** Prompt 3. You have a research briefing.

**Minute 5:** Prompt 4. You know what is reliable and what is not.

Total time: 5 minutes. Output: a multi perspective briefing with contradiction analysis, synthesis, a specific action, and a reliability score.

A PhD student takes 40 to 60 hours to produce this by hand. Not because they are slow. Because reading from 5 angles, mapping contradictions, synthesizing, and self critiquing is genuinely a 40 hour job for one human brain.

## Phase 8: 7 Ways to Use This Starting Today

**1. Before writing any article or report.** Run the 4 prompts. Your piece will cover angles nobody else thought of.

**2. Before a major business decision.** Get all 5 perspectives. The practitioner tells you what works in reality. The skeptic tells you what could go wrong. The economist tells you who profits.

**3. Before a job interview.** Research the company from 5 angles in 5 minutes. The practitioner view gives you insider language. The skeptic view gives you sharp questions. You walk in more prepared than anyone in the room.

**4. Before investing.** Bull case, bear case, historical parallel, incentive map, academic evidence. In 5 minutes. The contradiction map shows where the actual risk lives.

**5. Before learning a new skill.** Map the field from 5 angles. The practitioner tells you what to learn first. The academic tells you the theory. The skeptic tells you what is overhyped. You skip the noise.

**6. Before a negotiation.** Research the other side from 5 perspectives. Understand their incentives, weaknesses, historical behavior. You walk in with structural advantage.

**7. Before any presentation.** Run STORM on your topic. Your slides will answer objections before the audience raises them. Your Q and A will feel effortless.

## The Persona Block

You are someone who reads. You ask hard questions. You do not want a 200 word summary that sounds smart but says nothing.

You want to actually understand things. Quickly. With sources. The way a Stanford grad student would. Without the six year tuition bill.

That is who this method is for.

If that is you, save this article. Use the 4 prompts. Watch the difference.

## The Uncomfortable Truth

Here is what nobody is saying out loud.

The Stanford team published this in 2024. The paper is peer reviewed. The code is open source. The live tool is free. The method is four prompts. And almost nobody uses it.

We are in an 18 month window. The people who learn how to research with AI properly will out think the people who do not. By a lot. Not because they are smarter. Because they are running 5 perspectives, a contradiction map, a synthesis, and a peer review while everyone else is reading the first Google result.

In 18 months, this kind of workflow will be baked into every tool. The edge will be gone. Today it is still a secret hiding in plain sight.

Pick the topic you need to research most. Open Claude. Paste Prompt 1.

Five minutes from now you will know more than people who spent days reading.

The prompts are above. Stanford proved the method. The rest is up to you.
